                <p>
                    My name is Marzuk and I am an undergraduate at
                    the <span id="uw">University of Waterloo</span> studying
                    <span id="cs">Computer Science</span>. As of right now, 
                    I am a <span id="fed">Front-End Developer</span> with some 
                    Back-End experience. I plan to be a 
                    <span id="fsd">Full Stack Developer</span> by the end of June
                     2021. I have worked on many projects that required knowledge of 
                    languages such as Java, C/C++ as well as Front-End technologies 
                    such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br><br>This field has been my focus
                    for the last few years. Yet at the same time, I 
                    am also interested in AI, Cyber-Security and Networking among
                    many other fields. As someone with not
                    a lot of professional experience in the industry, I am not 
                    100% sure about where I want to be in 10 (or even 5) years 
                    though I am confident that I will continue in the Software industry. 
                     All I know is that I want to do something that lets me learn
                     and allows me to contribute to something meaningful. I am 
                    always looking for opportunities where I can learn and grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also while Computer Science is a passion of mine, it isn't the 
                    only one. I am also an avid <span id="ph">Photographer</span> 
                    with interests in urban and landscape photography. I also enjoy 
                    doing portraits from time to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am also a big believer in giving back to the community. As 
                    such I try to do as much as possible for my local community. 
                    I mainly do this through volunteering for local organizations 
                    that aim to do something for the community.

                <p id="passion">
                    My passion for <span>Photography</span> began
                    began at the age of 15 when I was given a
                    DSLR as a gift. Since then, I have learned a
                    great deal about photography and cameras in
                    general. I have taken thousands upon thousands
                    of pictures and with each one, I have tried to
                    make it better than the previous. Unfortunately,
                    COVID has made it harder to take pictures outside
                    and so, as a change of pace, I am learning product
                    photography as I can do it indoors. I'm
                    not working on a project at the moment so I'm
                    on the lookout to find something meaningful.<br><br>

                    Originally took this picture for creating a website as part of 
                    an English class. I wanted to go for a studious themed background. 
                    I am actually very proud of this one as it has the exact "feel" I 
                    was going for.

                    This one was a practice piece for a "product photography exercise". 
                    Definitely think that this would do great with a darker background 
                    and some editing.

                    turned out to be one of my favourite desktop backgrounds.

                <h3>Volunteering</h3>
                <p id="passion">
                    I am a PR in Canada and came here in 2019. When I came here, 
                    I was unaware of almost everything 
                    <span class="keep-tog">
                        (e.g how things work, what people are like etc.).
                    </span> However, without a second thought, people in the 
                    community welcomed us with open arms.
                     They helped us with everything that we had problems with. 
                     I am truly grateful for that. <br><br>
                    I think without the help from others', I wouldn't have been 
                    able to be where I am today. That is why I also want to help
                     others in a similar way. If I can help those in need, I want 
                     to be able to do that. The best way I can do that is 
                     through volunteering for organizations. <br><br> 
                     That is why I have been involved in my community for over 
                     years now. I have worked over 200+ hours across many organizations 
                     helping others in my community. I wish to keep doing the same.
